  title: RESTful Bitcoin payment channel protocol
  description: |
    A Bitcoin payment channel enables instant, secure transfer of bitcoins from one party to another. The intended use is consumer-to-merchant payments, allowing a consumer to make many small payments to a merchant - with whom the consumer has an open payment channel - while only paying the Bitcoin transaction fee once, when the channel is closed.
    
    The payment server speaking this protocol is the recipient of value, operating on behalf of a content delivery server who receives value from a customer/client. The content delivery server passes requests supplied by the client (payer) to the payment server, and delivers content to the client dependent on the response from the payment server.

      description: |
        Before opening a payment channel with the server, the client must first acquire the server public key, in order to calculate a funding address for the channel.
      
        The client will first calculate the funding address, confirm that it matches the server's, then pay to the funding address, and wait until the funding transaction has the server-specified number of confirmations ("funding_tx_min_conf").
        
        After this, the client will create a new payment of value equal to the server-specified channel open price ("open_price"), and POST this to the channel-open URL in order to open the channel.
